If you have arrived here by https://github.com/tonymorris/course and you are
looking for the *exercises* (not the answers), please go to

#### Introduction

The course is structured according to a linear progression and uses the Haskell
programming language to learn programming concepts pertaining to functional
programming.

Exercises are annotated with a comment containing the word "Exercise." The existing code compiles, however answers have
been replaced with a call to the Haskell `error` function and so the code will throw an exception if it is run. Some
exercises contain tips, which are annotated with a preceding "Tip:". It is not necessary to adhere to tips. Tips are
provided for potential guidance, which may be  discarded.

The exercises are designed in a way that requires personal guidance, so if you
attempt it on your own and feel a little lost, this is normal. All the
instructions are not contained herein.

### Getting Started

1. Install the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC) version 7.6 or higher.

2. Change to the directory containing this document.

3. Execute the command `ghci`, which will compile and load all the source code.
   You may need to set permissions on a file, `chmod 600 .ghci`.

4. The `Intro` module does not contain exercises. Its purpose is to demonstrate
   the structure of a project. The first recommend exercise is `Course.List`.

5. Edit a source file to a proposed solution to an exercise. At the `ghci`
   prompt, issue the command `:reload`. This will compile your solution and
   reload it in the GHC interpreter. You may use `:r` for short.

### Tips after having started

1. Some questions take a particular form. These are called *WTF questions*. WTF
   questions are those of this form or similar:
  * What does ____ mean?
  * What does the ____ function mean?
  * What is a ____ ?
  * Where did ____ come from ?
  * What is the structure of ____ ?

  They are all answerable with the `:info` command. For example, suppose you
  have the question, "What does the `swiggletwoop` function mean?" You may
  answer this at GHCi with:

  `> :info swiggletwoop`

  You may also use `:i` for short.

2. Functional Programming techniques rely heavily on types. This reliance may
   feel foreign at first, however, it is an important part of this course. If
   you wish to know the type of an expression or value, use `:type`. For
   example,

   `> :type reverse`

   `[t] -> [t]`

   This tells you that the `reverse` function takes a list of elements of some
   arbitrary type (`t`) and returns a list of elements of that same type. Try
   it.

   You may also use `:t` for short.

3. GHCi has TAB-completion. For example you might type the following:

   `> :type rev`

   Now hit the TAB key. If there is only one function in scope that begins with
   the characters `rev`, then that name will auto-complete. Try it. This
   completion is context-sensitive. For example, it doesn't make sense to ask
   for the type of a data type itself, so data type names will not auto-complete
   in that context, however, if you ask for `:info`, then they are included in
   that context. Be aware of this when you use auto-complete.

   This also works for file names:

   `> readFile "/etc/pas"`

   Now hit the TAB key. If there is only one existing filename on a path that
   begins with `/etc/pas`, then that name will auto-complete. Try it.

   If there is more than one identifier that can complete, hit TAB twice
   quickly. This will present you with your options to complete.

4. Follow the types.

   You may find yourself in a position of being unsure how to proceed for a
   given exercise. You are encouraged to adopt a different perspective. Instead
   of asking how to proceed, ask how you might proceed while adhering to the
   guideline provided by the types for the exercise at hand.

   It is possible to follow the types without achieving the desired goal,
   however, this is reasonably unlikely at the start. As you become more reliant
   on following the types, you will develop more trust in the potential paths
   that they can take you, including identification of false paths.

   Your instructor must guide you where types fall short, but you should also
   take the first step. Do it.

#### Running the tests

Some exercises include examples and properties, which appear in a comment above
the code for that exercise. Examples begin with `>>>` while properties begin
with `prop>`.

The solution to the exercise must satisfy these tests. You can check if you have
satisfied all tests with cabal-install and doctest. From the base directory of
this source code:

    > cabal update
    > cabal install cabal-install
    > cabal install --only-dependencies
    > cabal configure --enable-tests
    > cabal build
    > cabal test

Alternatively, you may run the tests in a single source file by using `doctest`
explicitly. From the base directory of this source code:

    > doctest -isrc -Wall -fno-warn-type-defaults <filename.hs>

Note: There is a [bug in GHC 7.4.1](http://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/5820)
where for some configurations, running the tests will cause an unjustified
compiler error.

### Progression

It is recommended to perform some exercises before others. The first step is to inspect the introduction modules.

* `Course.Id`
* `Course.Optional`
* `Course.Validation`

They contain examples of data structures and Haskell syntax. They do not contain exercises and exist to provide 
a cursory examination of Haskell syntax. The next step is to complete the exercises in `Course.List`.

After this, the following progression of modules is recommended:

* `Course.Functor`
* `Course.Apply`
* `Course.Applicative`
* `Course.Bind`
* `Course.Monad`
* `Course.FileIO`
* `Course.State`
* `Course.StateT`
* `Course.Extend`
* `Course.Comonad`
* `Course.ListZipper`
* `Course.Parser`
* `Course.MoreParser`
* `Course.JsonParser`
* `Course.Interactive`
* `Course.Anagrams`
* `Course.FastAnagrams`
* `Course.EditDistance`
* `Course.BKTree`
* `Course.Cheque`

After these are completed, complete the exercises in the `projects` directory.
